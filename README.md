# OpenMPI parallel solver of the 1d Finite Elements Method problem
Final project for CITS3402 at UWA (High Performance Computing)

Based on the paper `http://www.mcs.anl.gov/~zippy/publications/partrid/partrid.html` achieved linear speed up (75% / core efficiency) (tested on up to 32 nodes) via OpenMPI.
